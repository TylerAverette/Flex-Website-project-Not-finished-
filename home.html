					I like to chill and relax while playing the game. I can get competitive when
					needed, but I prefer a relaxed game-play style. I'm the party clown. I will make you
					laugh while playing.<br />

				<h2 align= center>About<h2>
				<p>
					We are a fun and competitive clan that like to kick back, have fun, and joke around. However, we 
					often take our games seriously which leads to limiting voice chat to positional, rotational, 
					and information based call-outs in order to ensure our teammates gain the advantage by hearing their 
					enemies first.We aren't actively recruiting at this time, but the right candidate could be approved at
					times when we are not seeking to recruit new members.We love helping new clan members, when any 
					member of our clan has a skill increase, every member benefits. This is why we believe that any 
					player can always learn from better players or teach new clan members.

				I like to relax and have fun, I'm the sniper of the group. I hang back and provide support. 
				My favorite weapons in shooter games are sniper rifles. They fit my play-style the best.<br />
